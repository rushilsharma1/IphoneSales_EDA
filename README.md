 # IphoneSales_EDA

To create a project for iPhone sales exploratory data analysis using Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

Step 1: Import necessary libraries Import essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to read and manipulate the data.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Step 2: Load the dataset Load the iPhone sales dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

diab_df = pd.read_csv(Iphone_data.csv)

Step 3: Data Analysis Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset, including:

Head and Tail: View the first and last few rows of the dataset.
Shape: Check the dimensions of the dataset.
Dtypes: Verify the data types of each column.
Describe: Generate summary statistics for the dataset.

Step 4: Data Visualization Create visualizations to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them, including:

Bar chart: Visualize the distribution of the "Outcome" variable.
Boxplots: Compare the distribution of each independent variable for patients with and without diabetes.
Pairplot: Visualize the relationships between all numerical variables in the dataset.
Heatmap: Represent the correlation matrix of the dataset.

Step 5: Modeling Building Build a machine learning model to predict iPhone sales based on the analyzed data.
